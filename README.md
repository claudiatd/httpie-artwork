# Artwork for HTTPIE

This logo is a graphic mark for Httpie: A human friendly Command line HTTP client.

The logo plays with the literal meaning of pie. The filling is a cloud – which is increasingly becoming the main symbol for web services. The base is what makes it manageable – represents the simple and natural syntax of the Interface. Easy as pie!
